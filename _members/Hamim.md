I am an Assistant Professor jointly in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, IIT Kanpur. Previously, I held postdoctoral position at the Computational Biology Department, Carnegie Mellon University. At Carnegie Mellon University, I was a recipient of the Lane Fellowship. I completed my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science, Rice University. My research interests lie at the intersection of Computation and Biology. We develop Probabilistic Models and Statistical Inference Algorithms for solving computational problems in different fields of Biology including Tumor biology, Developmental biology, Single-cell biology and so on. Please visit my research page to know more about my research.

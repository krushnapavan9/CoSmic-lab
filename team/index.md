# <i class="fas fa-users"></i>Team

Our lab is made up of a highly engaged and collaborative team of researchers. Since diversity leads to improved research, we have a diverse set of researchers from different academic backgrounds. We foster an environment where team members are treated equally, and where we respect and admire our differences. The team currently includes PhD students, MTech and MS students and UG students. We are always looking for curious minds to join our team.
